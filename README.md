# CSN_classification

Provided here are the gene lists described in Golan et. al., 2023


The purpose of these gene lists is to aid in corticospinal neuron classification among other excitatory L2/3 and L5 neurons in M1 (CSN-C) and to enable training of custom models to classify corticospinal neurons based on whether they are forelimb CSNs or hindlimb CSNs (LS-CSN-C). 

In addition to the gene lists, we provide example classifiers (linear SVMs), sample data to run the classifiers and example jupyter notebooks.
