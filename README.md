# CSN_classification

Provided here are the classification tools (linear SVMs) described in Golan et. al., 2022


The purpose of these tools is to aid in corticospinal neuron classification among other excitatory L2/3 and L5 neurons in M1 (CSN-C) and to classify corticospinal neurons based on whether they are forelimb CSNs or hindlimb CSNs (LS-CSN-C). 

In addition to the classifiers, we provide example jupyter notebooks to aid in implimentation.
